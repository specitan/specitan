# Hey there! It's me `specitan`! ðŸ‘»

> I code in a variety of languages, so let's keep it simple.

I live in NYC, and I love coding and I especially love messing with API's!

**Some projects I have done/have been doing:**

<li>An API Wrapper for the MTA</li>

<li>A discord bot focused on tracking buses, tracking routes and stop codes based entirely around the MTA.</li>

<li>A command handler package for Discord.JS v14</li>
<br>

The languages I code in are: 

**<li>Javascript</li>**
**<li>Typescript</li>**
**<li>HTML</li>**
**<li>Node</li>**
